Description
GTM systems is a large IT company with offices all around the world. The
company delivers software products and services to corporate clients. One
of the reasons for its enduring success and consistent performance over
the years is the ability to leverage technology and find innovative
applications for it.

Problem Statement and Motivation
While GTM has no expertise in meteorology, it proposes to aggregate weather data
from multiple providers and uses analytics to correlate it with meaningful
conclusions for businesses.
Example use cases could be generating forecasts based on local weather conditions
around:
• Consumption of hot versus cold beverages depending on cold, sunny, or rainy
weather
• Number of visitors to a tourist site or an open
air entertainment event
• Likelihood of seasonal illnesses such as flu in particular locations
The main system will comprise a web portal and a set of “apps” available on the
popular mobile operating systems. Apart from this, clients can ask for specific
services or apps based on the insights that the analytics can generate.
