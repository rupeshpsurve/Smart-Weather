Hi  I am Rupesh

below is overview of my work experience in project management.

Currently a Project Management Trainee at Fortray Global Services with a PGDBA in Business Administration and a BSc in Science. I bring hands-on experience supporting digital transformation and system implementation projects using tools like Power BI, Jira, MS Project, and Confluence. Certified as a PRINCE2 Practitioner and Scrum Master, I contribute across full project lifecycles with a focus on planning, risk mitigation, and stakeholder coordination.

Previously led GSS compliance reporting at Anglian Water and managed LMS migration across EMEA for Boston Scientific. I’m now seeking junior project management or coordination roles where I can apply my skills in agile delivery, cross-functional collaboration, and data-driven decision-making.
